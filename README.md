# PasswordGenerator

## Purpose
This Password generator lets you decide between many different character sets to customize your random password. Thanks to my classmates for explaining some of the concepts that helped me reach a better understanding and complete this challenge. The generator will ask prompt for the password length, followed by character inclusion/exclusions.
